# calculator

//First Thoughts//

Well I finally start my final project from the foundations section on TOP. I'm proud of myself for making it this far. I was working and babysitting during the summer so I have no idea how I made it here but I did. I know my commit habits have still been lackluster. Once again I'm going to try to improve them here. For me it goes full circle because the first project I tried creating back in 11th grade was a calculator. I gave up because I had no idea what I was doing. Here I am tackling the challenge once again but this time I do not count on giving up. Welp here I go!
